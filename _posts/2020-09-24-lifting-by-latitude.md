<img align="left" style="float:left; padding-right:10px" src="/assets/img/istockphoto-841956772-170667a.jpg"> The surface of the Earth at the equator spins roughly 1,000 miles per hour.  As a result of this insane rotation, Earth actually bulges out at the equator, forming an oblate spheroid rather than simply a sphere.  This also means that the diameter around the equator is larger than the diameter connecting the poles.  And so, a person standing on the surface at the equator, being further from the center of the Earth than a person standing on the surface at the poles, experiences less gravity (approximately 0.5% less, in fact!).
